# Dashboard Redesign Summary 🎨

## What Was Wrong Before?

The old dashboard showed raw JSON data that looked like this:
```json
{
  "total_assets": 6000.0,
  "total_liabilities": 0.0,
  "net_worth": 6000.0
}
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Not user-friendly at all
- ❌ No visual charts or graphs
- ❌ Hard to understand financial status at a glance
- ❌ No way to manage profile with photo
- ❌ No easy way to add accounts, transactions, budgets
- ❌ Just showed system health (for developers, not users)
